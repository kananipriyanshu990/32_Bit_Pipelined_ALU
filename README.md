# Pipelined ALU in Verilog

## Overview

This project implements a fully synthesizable 32-bit Pipelined Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog HDL. The design follows a modular RTL methodology and demonstrates how instructions, operands, control signals, addresses, and status flags can be coordinated through a multi-stage pipeline architecture.

The project was developed as a digital design and RTL engineering exercise with a strong emphasis on clean architecture, modularity, verification, documentation, and industry-style design practices.

## Architecture

The design is divided into multiple independent RTL blocks:

### Control Unit

Decodes instructions, generates control signals, manages register addressing, and coordinates pipeline activity.

### Register File

Stores operands and computed results. Supports two simultaneous read ports and one write port.

### Pipeline Registers

Separate adjacent pipeline stages and maintain synchronization between control information and datapath information.

### ALU Core

Performs arithmetic, logical, shift, inversion, and comparison operations while generating status flags.

### Top-Level Integration Module

Connects all submodules and forms the complete pipelined processing system.

---

## Pipeline Flow

### Stage 1 — Instruction Decode

* Instruction received
* Opcode extracted
* Source and destination addresses decoded

### Stage 2 — Operand Fetch

* Operands read from Register File
* Values stored in pipeline registers

### Stage 3 — Execute

* ALU operation performed
* Status flags generated

### Stage 4 — Writeback

* Result written into destination register
* Instruction execution completed

Multiple instructions may occupy different stages simultaneously, improving throughput compared to a non-pipelined implementation.

---

## Status Flags

### Carry Flag

Indicates unsigned carry generation during arithmetic operations.

### Overflow Flag

Indicates signed arithmetic overflow.

### Zero Flag

Asserted when the ALU result equals zero.

### Negative Flag

Reflects the sign bit of the ALU result.

## Verification

The project has been verified using SystemVerilog testbenches at both module level and top level.

Verification includes:

* Instruction decoding
* Register file read/write operations
* Pipeline synchronization
* ALU functionality
* Flag generation
* Writeback behavior
* Reset operation
* Integration testing

Waveform analysis was performed to validate timing relationships between operands, addresses, results, and control signals.
